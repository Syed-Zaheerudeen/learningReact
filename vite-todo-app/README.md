# this todo app is used to learn the practical use case of useContext, createContext in react
key errors:
always send props & values of context inside a object
define global variables and functions in a single file where we use context provider and use these methods on any other components

*always have a clear logic before starting to code (i.e. don't think while coding prepare the logic first then code it).
